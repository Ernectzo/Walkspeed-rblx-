This is a simple walkspeed script for Roblox. For some reason it just refuses to execute through a loadstring 

SO

Copy and paste the source code directly into the executor

OR

Put the local script in Roblox studio

ALSO

Very soon, one script will have a speed animation while the other will not.

This script will be getting a forked version but not archive the main one so look out for that.
