This is a simple walkspeed script for Roblox. Execute it through this loadstring.

loadstring(game:HttpGet(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ernectzo/Walkspeed-rblx-/main/Obfuscated.lua”, true))()

OR

Put the local script

ALSO

Very soon, one script will have a speed animation while the other will not.

This script will be getting a forked version but not archive the main one so look out for that.
